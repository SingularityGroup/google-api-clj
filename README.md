# google-api-clj

Singularity group fork of https://github.com/viebel/google-api-clj

## reasoning

The original repo is a bit older.
The ecosystem is moving towards builtin tooling.
Also I wanted to try make this lib compatible with graalvm.

## todo

- [x] Move to deps.edn
- [x] Fix core functions override warns from clojure 10.11
- [ ] Get rid of reflection
- [ ] Do not initialize classes, if building for graalvm
- [ ] Achieve graalvm compatibility


## Usage

add deps:


        viebel/google-api-clj
        {:git/sha "47fd758f" :git/url "git@github.com:SingularityGroup/google-api-clj.git"}


```clojure
(def credential-path "<path-to-google-api-creds>.json")

(def google-client (create-google-client {:credential-path credential-path
                                            :scopes [:drive :spreadsheets]
                                            :application-name ""}))

  (def sheets-service (sheets/make-service google-client))

(def my-spreadheet (sheets/create-spreadsheet
                      {:service sheets-service}
                      {:spreadsheet-properties/title "Showtime! repl test"}
                      [{:sheet-properties/title "Code bold!"}]))
```

check the api namespaces + the google api docs.
